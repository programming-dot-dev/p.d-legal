## 1. Expected Behaviour

The following are expected behaviour for people interacting on our sites.

- 1.1. **Remember the human:** When interacting with other people on the site they should be interacted with as if they are a human, that is with respect and in a way that you would want to be treated.
- 1.2. **Keep in mind software differences:** As this is the fediverse, not everyone is interacting from the same software or the same type of software (people in microblogs may join in to the threaded posts, etc.). Due to this not everyone has access to the same features we do so features should not be assumed to be standard (e.g. visible pronouns, markdown, votes).
- 1.3. **Vote for quality:** When downvoting content in communities the downvotes should reflect the quality of the content rather than whether you personally agree with it.
