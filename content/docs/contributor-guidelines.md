# ðŸª² Contributor Guidelines

These contributor guidelines detail expected behaviours and ways you may contribute to sites and services created by programming.dev.

Most things we make are open source and available on our software forge https://git.programming.dev.

## Follow the Code of Conduct

When participating in discussions and contributing code to our software forges, it is expected that you and content you create follows our Code of Conduct.

## Respect Licenses

When contributing code to programming.dev, do not contribute code you do not have the proper copyright to use. Code should follow the license level we currently have which in most repositories will be MIT. This means that MIT repositories should not include things like code licensed under AGPL or other copyleft licenses.

## How to Contribute

To contribute to a repository you can fork the repository on git.programming.dev (or on the mirrors of the repositories on github if they exist) and add in the changes to your fork. When it is ready you can make a pull request to the mai nrepository to get it merged into the main codebase.

Before working on a feature open up an issue for it on the repository so that it may be discussed and refined before work begins.

If you want to contribute ideas or bug reports rather than code feel free to open up issues on the relevant repository.

## Do we Make Updates to These Contributor Guidelines?

We may update these Contributor Guidelines from time to time. When we do the date at the bottom of the page will change to indicate the date of the most recent changes. In addition, clicking on that date will bring you to the commit in the code repository that shows who edited it, and what was changed. If we make changes we may notify you by posting a notice of such changes in our meta community on the programming.dev site, in the updates account on the bytes.programming.dev site, in our blog on the stacks.programming.dev site, in the news community in our discord server, and in the news community in our matrix server. We encourage you to review the Contributor Guidelines periodically for any modifications.
